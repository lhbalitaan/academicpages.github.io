I am a Research Data Analyst in the [Scripps Acoustic Ecology Lab](http://baumann.ucsd.edu/) at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. My current research focuses on using MATLAB to analyze passive and acoustic array data to understand the spatiotemporal distrubution and ecology of various baleen whales and beaked whales.

My passion for marine mammal ecology and physics has allowed me excel in the interdisciplinary world of marine bioacoustics. Just by placing an underwater microphone (hydrophone) in the ocean, I am able to study the seasonal distribution, movement, and foraging patterns of cetaceans.

I want to then compare this data to the locations of Marine Protected Areas (MPA) and bring awareness to policy makers, stakeholders, and government officials on whether an existing MPA should be moved, expanded, or left alone, or if a new MPA should be created.

Why is this important?

Proteting biodiversity -- including cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) -- in the oceans is critical to protecting Earth's system. Like a machine, if one constituent, but critical, part of Erath's system struggles or is even missing, the whole system will start to break. My interest in "saving the whales" goes beyond saving these charismatic and intelligent creatures. They play an important role in many food webs and the movement of carbon.

I strongly believe in the power science communication holds. Being able to effectively explain the importance of a scientific topic and how it affects people in ways they didn't know is key! 

Looking past informing government officals and policy makers about pressing issues, without effective science communication, how and why would your friends, family, and peers care about science? I strongly believe that NO ONE should be excluded from science. While I lived in Santa Barbara, I volunteered at many outreach programs to inform the public-- especially elementary and middle school children of marginalized and underrepresented backgrounds-- on not just how fascinating science is, but also how they shouldn't "leave science stuff up to the experts" because science doesn't discriminate -- it affects everybody.

When I'm not wrestling with MATLAB, you can catch me snorkeling, doing yoga, or country line dancing.
