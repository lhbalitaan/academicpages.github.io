I am a research data analyst in the [Scripps Acoustic Ecology Lab](http://baumann.ucsd.edu/) at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. My current research focuses on using MATLAB to analyze passive and acoustic array data to understand the spatiotemporal patterns of baleen whales.

My passion for marine mammal ecology and physics has allowed me excel in the interdisciplinary world of marine bioacoustics. Just by dipping an underwater microphone (aka hydrophone) in the ocean, we are able to study more than just the seasonal distribution and foraging patterns of cetaceans. We can also listen to the all the noise from cargo ships, oil surveys, and other anthropogenic underwater sounds and study how marine mammals change their behavior to this increasingly noisy environment. This goes unnoticed and is often overlooked because of the general public's detachment from the everything that goes on in the vastness of the ocean.

Science issues like this is what wants me to tell everybody! I strongly believe that NO ONE should be excluded from science. During my time in Santa Barbara, I volunteered at a bunch of outreach programs to inform the public-- especially elementary and middle school children of marginalized and underrepresented backgrounds-- on the not just the importance of science, but also how cool it can be.

When I'm not wrestling with MATLAB or telling people about science, you can catch me snorkeling, doing yoga, and country line dancing.
