## 2019 California Current Ecoystem Long-Term Ecological Response Research Experience for Undergraduates (CCE LTER REU)

![Figure 1](https://lhbalitaan.github.io/files/CCELTER_Flyer.pdf)

I worked in the Miller Lab where I used MATLAB to plot and analyze 11 physical and biological variables from the coupled ocean and ecosystem model, ROMS-NEMURO, to better understand how biophysical interactions within the California Current System change in response to El Niño. Along with another intern, Pauline Pan, we created composite correlation plots of each variable during El Niño, normal, and La Niña conditions. I then analyzed each variable, individually and collectively, to discover and characterize trends that we presented at the end of the summer program.
