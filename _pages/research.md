In the Miller Lab, I supported PhD candidate, Nathali Cordero-Quir칩s, on her research of understanding how biophysical interactions within the California Current System change in response to El Ni침o. Along with another intern, Pauline Pan, we used MATLAB to plot and analyze 11 physical and biological variables from the coupled ocean and ecosystem model, ROMS-NEMURO. Together, we created composite correlation plots of each variable during El Ni침o, normal, and La Ni침a conditions. I then analyzed each variable, individually and collectively, to discover and characterize trends that we presented at the end of the summer program.
